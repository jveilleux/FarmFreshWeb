# Product properties \(i.e. certified organic, free range etc\)

You can apply product properties to your products, as a way of letting your customers know more about how your products are produced and what their characteristics are. Current product properties that can be applied include:

* Regional
* Grass Fed
* Minimum Spray
* Native Veg Regen
* Preservative Free
* Locally Grown
* Low Food Miles

* Naturally Ripened

* No Preservatives

* Organic- Certified

* Organic- Not Certified

* Free Range

* Biodynamic- Certified

_\*If you wish to apply a product property which is not listed here, get in touch and we will consider creating a new on, if there is widespread demand._

There are two ways to assign properties to your products:

1\) You can assign a property to an enterprise, so that all products belonging to that enterprise will carry this property \(unless it’s manually removed, which is covered in the **“Inherited Properties” **section below\).

2\) You can assign properties to particular products, on an individual basis.

## 1\) Assigning a property to an enterprise

When you assign a property to an enterprise, all products belonging to that enterprise will, by default, carry that product property. For instance, if all of your products are ‘Minimum Spray’, you can assign this property to your enterprise, to save you from needing to manually apply this property to every product. If a property only applies to a few of your products, it’s better to apply it to the product, instead of the enterprise \(instructions below\).

You can access enterprise properties in one of two ways: In the **Enterprise **tab, you can select ‘Properties’ next to the corresponding enterprise \(below\).

Or you can click **Properties **in the enterprise profile management section \(below\).

Next, there are 2 fields when applying an enterprise property:

**Property: **You can select a pre-defined product property from the dropdown list. This is the name of the property that your products will be tagged with, and which customers will be able to filter for in your shop.

**Value: **You can write a description of how this product property applies to your enterprise in this field. For example, if you have selected the property ‘Organic- Certified’ in the property field, you could write the certification number in the value field. Or if you have selected the property ‘Free Range’ you could write a more detailed description of how your animals are raised in the value field.

_\* You can apply multiple properties to your enterprise_

## 2\) Assigning a property to a product

To assign a property to a single product, rather than an enterprise’s entire product range, click on **Products **in the horizontal blue banner, and then edit an existing product \(you cannot apply a product property when you are first creating a product\).

Once you are editing the product,  click on ![](http://openfoodfoundation.org/sites/default/files/Product properties click.png)on the right hand side.

There are 2 fields when applying a product property:

**Property: **You can select a pre-defined product property from the dropdown list. This is the name of the property that your product will be tagged with, and which customers will be able to filter for in your shop.

**Description: **You can write a description of how this product property applies to this product. For example, if you have selected the property ‘Organic- Certified’ in the property field, you could write the certification number in the value field. Or if you have selected the property ‘Free Range’ you could write a more detailed description of how your animals are raised in the description field.

You can apply multiple product properties by clicking “**+ Add Product Properties**“

Remember to click **update **when you are finished.

## Inherited Properties

As discussed above, when an enterprise is assigned a property, all products belonging to that enterprise will ‘inherit’ this property. However, an enterprise may not wish for all of their products to inherit this property. Thus, it is possible to remove this property from products.

When editing a product’s properties \(accessed here ![](http://openfoodfoundation.org/sites/default/files/Product properties click_1.png)\) you will see a checkbox titled **“Inherit properties from \(Enterprise Name\) \(Unless Overridden Above\)”. **By default, when an enterprise has a property, it this box will be checked for all products belonging to the enterprise. Unchecking this box will remove any enterprise properties that have been inherited.

The ‘unless overridden above’ component of the checkbox means that if you have a product with the same property, both inherited and applied, the applied property ‘value’ field will override the inherited one. For example, a producer primarily stocks beef products, in addition to some cartons of eggs. They have applied the free range property to their enterprise, with a value \(description\) of ‘Stocking density of 4 cattle to an acre’. Their ‘carton of egg’ product is also ‘free range’ however the value needs to be ‘our chickens live in a mobile egg van, at a density 50 chickens to an acre’. The carton of egg property can have the ‘Inherit properties..’ checkbox ticked, but will also need a ‘free range’ property created, with the correct value field.

You can add properties to a product in addition to those inherited from the enterprise \(by keeping the checkbox ticked and adding a property above\). Or you can remove the inherited property and add additional ones. This allows products to carry a combination of individual properties and enterprise properties.

## How product properties are displayed in the shop

In the shopfront, customers can see product properties by clicking on the product information popout window.

Properties which apply to the product are shown as an icon, next to the product category.

Customers can also search according to product properties within a shop. This tool is placed in the top right hand corner of the store and allows customer to search for products according to their properties.
