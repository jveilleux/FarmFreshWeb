# Create an account

To create an account go to farmfreshweb.com/register. This process will step you through creating an account, and also help you to add details to your profile. Whether you want to simply have an FFW profile, or you want to create an online shop, creating an account, and filling out your profile is the first step.

The process takes around 5-10 minutes, and we’ll ask for your enterprise details \(address, contact details\), a logo image and landscape banner image and a description for your ‘about us’ section.

Once you’ve finished, we’ll send you confirmation email with further details.
