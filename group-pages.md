# Group Pages

**What is a group page? **Group pages are a way for groups to have their own personalized directory on the FFW. Group pages are suited to regional producer groups, certification bodies, farmer’s markets and large multi-hub groups.

**How can I create a group page? **To create a group and become an administrator of a group, you’ll need to contact us first so we can set this up.

## Managing a Group Page

Once you’ve been designated the administrator of a group, you’ll be able to view and edit your group by clicking on **Groups **in the horizontal blue menu. Then click on the **edit **icon next to your group.

##### **Primary Details**

**Name: **Select a name for your group

**Description: **This is just a short description of your hub, which will be visible on the front of your group page.

**On Front Page: **Select the tick box if your group is ready to be visible on the FFW. Do not check this box if you don’t want your group page to be visible yet.

**Enterprises: **Select the enterprises who you want to be members of your group. You can search through all of the enterprises currently on the FFW and make them a member of your group. Please make sure you have permission to add enterprises to your group before doing so. Note, if you have already added an enterprise to your group, they will no longer show in the search box.

**Permalink: **This is the final component of your group page’s URL, after www.farmfreshweb.com/groups/

##### Users

**Owner: **This is the owner of the group page. Only this user has permission to edit the page and manage its membership. Please contact us if you wish to change the owner.

##### About

All group pages have an ‘About Us’ tab. This is where you can provide more detailed information about your group. Note you can use the different headings \(H1, H2, H3…\) to structure this page into paragraphs.

##### Images

**Logo:**This should be a square image. It will show in the group listing page and on your group’s page.

**Promo Image:**This image will sit at the top of your group page. It’s best if this image has banner proportions, being long across the screen and not too tall. We recommend 1200 x 260 pixels.

##### Contact

You have the option of providing a phone number, email address and address for your group.

##### Web

Provide links to any websites and social media channels you may have.
