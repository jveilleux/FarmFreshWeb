# Farmers Market profile types

When you first create your profile, you’ll be prompted to select the ‘type’ of profile you want. Your selection here dictates the functionality that your profile will have.

_\* Note: The above relates to Australian users only. Local instances may vary._

1. **Profile Only:**
    This option allows you to create a profile on the FFW. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you.
2. **Farmers Market Shop**
   : This option provides you with a complete online store for your farmers market, in addition to the profile.

You can change your account type at any time in the future. This can be done by clicking the ‘**Change package**‘ button on [the dashboard](/the-dashboard.md). Or you can change your producer/non producer status and and profile/shop package by selecting **Enterprise **on the blue horizontal banner, and then editing your enterprise’s settings \(see below\).
